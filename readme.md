## Inspiration
We want to tackle one of the greatest problems in Vietnam conservation, which is lacking awareness between stakeholders in conservation about communal efforts. Therefore, we want to make a project which is feasible, yet novel to tackle the long-lasting problem, which has cost stakeholders enormous efforts to compensate.
## What it does
- Automatically collect and visualize the data
- Work as a knowledge-sharing hub between stakeholders
## How we built it
- We crawl data from conservation report, then we filter and visualize it on a website using python
## Challenges we ran into
- Coding competence
- Time allocate
- Website developing
## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
- Our project
- Ourselves
## What we learned
- Teamwork matters
- It is not easy as it seems to be
- Take time to write code
## What’s next for Vietnam Wildlife Trafficking Map
- Scale-up both in terms of range and functions
- Work with stakeholders to bring the project come true
